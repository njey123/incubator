How Incubator Works
-------------------

- built an incubator for eggs using an Arduino
- monitors temperature changes and outputs current temperature to Arduino Serial Monitor
- rotates specimen periodically (supposed to be rotate every 4 hours) -> timer interrupt is used to periodically turn on DC motor
- light bulb provides heat
- red/green LED feedback
- computer fan allows for circulation of air
- fan rotates at full speed when the light bulb is off, when the incubator is above the threshold temperature (to cool the incubator)
- fan rotates at half speed when the light bulb is on
- motor shield
